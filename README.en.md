## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction

[Homepage Creators](https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang/Homepage-Creators) is a personal homepage theme for [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), styled similarly to Apple, beautiful and elegant.

> Note: This theme is a port of the open-source [HeoWeb](https://github.com/zhheo/HeoWeb) static theme, thanks to [Zhang Hong Heo](https://blog.zhheo.com/) for the generous sharing.

This theme is easy to use; you only need to modify the `config.toml` file to dynamically adjust the content. There is no need to modify HTML content like in the upstream repository, greatly reducing the cognitive burden on users.
