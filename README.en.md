## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction

[Homepage Creators](https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang/Homepage-Creators) is a personal homepage theme for [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), styled similarly to Apple, beautiful and elegant.

> Note: This theme is a port of the open-source [HeoWeb](https://github.com/zhheo/HeoWeb) static theme, thanks to [Zhang Hong Heo](https://blog.zhheo.com/) for the generous sharing.

This theme is easy to use; you only need to modify the `config.toml` file to dynamically adjust the content. There is no need to modify HTML content like in the upstream repository, greatly reducing the cognitive burden on users.

   - [Zola command documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/cli-usage/)
   - [Understanding project structure](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure/)
   - [Customization](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/)

1. Modify the `config.toml` configuration file as needed; you should have a basic understanding of TOML format.

1. Place your image assets in the `static/img` folder as needed

## Formal Usage

This section's solution differs from directly modifying the repository code mainly in content isolation. Based on the Zola blog framework mechanism, installing this repository's code as a theme allows complete isolation between theme updates and user modifications, enabling long-term use and avoiding technical debt.

For formal usage, it's assumed you have basic knowledge of the [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) framework and Git Submodules. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Install the Zola command-line tool locally, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
1. Use the `zola` command to initialize a new website locally (your personal homepage) and initialize it as a Git repository. The command format is `zola init <site name>`
1. Install this theme repository as a Git Submodule in your website
   ```bash
   git submodule add -b main https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang/Homepage-Creators themes
   ```
   At this point, your repository should automatically create a `themes/Homepage-Creators` folder
1. Download the repository contents
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init
   ```
   Now, the `themes/Homepage-Creators` folder should have content
1. Configure the new website to use this theme by modifying the `config.toml` file's property to `theme = "Homepage-Creators"`
1. Refer to the [Customize Your Homepage](#customize-your-homepage) section to modify the `config.toml` configuration file as needed; you should have a basic understanding of TOML format.

Afterwards, your personal homepage website can be maintained as a separate Git repository.

To update the theme, you only need to update the Git Submodule's branch/tag/code.

## Customize Your Homepage

Customization is very simple! No code changes are needed, as I've modularized the sections. You only need to:

1. Place your image assets in the `static/img` folder (the most time-consuming and challenging work is actually image creation...)
2. Modify the `config.toml` file to configure sections, text content, and referenced images
3. Run the `zola serve` command to preview the homepage locally, with real-time refresh support

To customize your homepage, you need a basic understanding of the Zola framework, such as [understanding project structure](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/directory-structure/) and [configuration files](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/). These are very simple concepts that only require a single read-through.

### Basic Configuration

You can configure website information in the `config.toml` file as follows:

```toml
[extra.site]
# Website establishment year, used for generating copyright content
start_year = 2024
# Website Logo
logo = "/img/logo.webp"
# Navigation bar Logo, defaults to website Logo if empty
nav_logo = "/img/logo.webp"
# Contact email
mail = "contact@example.com"
# ICP filing number (for Chinese websites)
compliance_icp = "ICPÂ§áXXXXXXXXÂè∑"
# Public security filing number (for Chinese websites)
compliance_security = "ÂÖ¨ÁΩëÂÆâÂ§á0000000000Âè∑"
# Public security filing link (for Chinese websites)
compliance_security_link = "https://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/registerSystemInfo?recordcode=0000000000"

[extra.other]
# Enable AVIF image format conversion to significantly reduce image size
avif_enable = true
```

### Navigation Menu

You can configure the content of the **top navigation bar** and **notifications** in the `config.toml` file as follows:

```toml
[extra.nav]

# Notification popup below navigation bar
[extra.nav.message]
enable = true
# support inline html
text = "üéâ Visit Author's Blog"
url = "https://blog.jiaxiang.wang"

# Center navigation bar configuration
[extra.nav.center]
menus = [
    # Set internal = true, url as text indicates internal navigation, page scrolls to specific section
    { name = "Home", url = "Home", internal = true},
    { name = "Theme", url = "Theme", internal = true},
    { name = "Blog", url = "Blog", internal = true},
    { name = "Media", url = "Media", internal = true},
    # Set internal = false, url as link indicates external navigation
    { name = "Projects", url = "https://blog.jiaxiang.wang/tags/project/", internal = false},
]

# Right navigation bar configuration
[extra.nav.right]
menus = [
    { name = "Author's Blog", url = "https://blog.jiaxiang.wang", internal = false},
    { name = "Author's Github", url = "https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang", internal = false},
]
```

### Content Sections

You can flexibly customize sections according to your needs. Except for the top navigation bar, any section of the page is a **modular component** that can have **unlimited customization of order and quantity**.

Using sections is very simple, just paste the **section configuration code at the end of `config.toml`**, after the `[extra.other]` Section. The first line of configuration code is uniformly `[[extra.index.widgets]]`, where `[[ ]]` represents an array in TOML syntax.

**The order of sections matches the order of addition**, meaning you can adjust the code order in the `config.toml` file to control the page display order.

If you have any doubts, the quickest way is to reference this project's [config.toml file](https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang/Homepage-Creators/blob/main/config.toml).

Currently supported modular components are as follows:

#### Modular Component Section: Header Content

# Right side image
cover = "/img/logo.svg"
# Small buttons next to "Learn More", can add/remove as needed, usually for social media links
[[extra.index.widgets.value.links]]
class_icon = " icon-github-line"
url = "https://github.com/iWangJiaxiang"
